# CS498RK-Final_Project

## Project Description

This is a College Research/ Intern/ Grader Opportunity Share Platform. Our motivation is to reduce this gap of information asymmetry, accelerate the process for both students and professors to find their match. 

The key functions of this web app include enabling users to filter and search for research/intern/grader opportunities on campus, viewing the details about these opportunies, and posting new opportunies if the user is a professor or faculty member.
